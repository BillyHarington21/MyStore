The application is built based on the principles of Onion Architecture, utilizing the DTO pattern and microservices on the .NET 8.0.10 platform. All required packages will be automatically downloaded upon launch in the IDE, and dependencies between projects are configured accordingly. The scripts for stored procedures used in the database are stored in the DataBaseScripts file of the Domein project.

I did not include scripts for loading data from Excel tables or the archive with images, but I can mention that I used BULK INSERT for both. I tried to create the most user-friendly frontend possible using ASP.NET MVCâ€”please don't judge too harshly.

Database: SQL Server 2022
IDE: Visual Studio 2022
